# Distributed Control of Underactuated and Heterogeneous Mechanical Systems: Simulations
This repository contains supplementary material for the MSc thesis:

L. Valk, [_Distributed Control of Underactuated and Heterogeneous Mechanical Systems_](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:f689e074-d744-4f63-865e-3c59a7e69dfd)

And the conference paper for the 7th IFAC Workshop on Distributed Estimation and Control in Networked Systems (NecSys 2018):

L. Valk and T. Keviczky, _Distributed Control of Heterogeneous Underactuated Mechanical Systems_

----

The code for running the simulations is included as Jupyter-notebooks in this repository. It requires installation of the [systemsim](https://github.com/laurensvalk/systemsim) package.
