# Distributed Control of Underactuated and Heterogeneous Mechanical Systems: Simulations
This repository contains supplementary material for the MSc thesis:

L. Valk, _Distributed Control of Underactuated and Heterogeneous Mechanical Systems_

A link to an online version of the thesis will be added shortly.

The code for running the simulations is included as Jupyter-notebooks in this repository. It requires installation of the [systemsim](https://github.com/laurensvalk/systemsim) package.
